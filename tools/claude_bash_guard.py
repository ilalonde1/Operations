"""PreToolUse guard for Bash: block the mistakes this repo has actually paid for.

CLAUDE.md states every one of these in prose. Prose is read once at the start of a session
and then loses to momentum -- on 2026-08-25 all four were broken, each within minutes of the
rule being quoted out loud. A hook fires at the moment of the action, which is the only
moment that matters.

No jq: it is not installed on this machine, and a jq-based hook exits 0 silently, which
reads as "allowed" and protects nothing.

stdin  : the PreToolUse payload
stdout : nothing (allow), or a permissionDecision of "deny"
